This folder contains the `.stl` 3D model files that are ready to be sent to a 3D printer to be sliced and printed.

For descriptions of the designs, see the README in the sibling `/scads` directory.

To view any particular design just click on it and GitHub will render it here in the browser for you.

You can then right click on the `Raw` button and select "Save link as..." to download it if you do not want to clone this whole repository.
