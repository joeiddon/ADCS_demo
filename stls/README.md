This folder contains the `.stl` 3D model files that are ready to be sent to a 3D printer to be sliced and printed.

See the README in the parent `scads` directory for descriptions of the designs here.

To view any particular design just click on it and GitHub will render it here in the browser for you.

You can then right click on the `Raw` button and select "Save link as..." to download it if you do not want to clone this whole repository.
